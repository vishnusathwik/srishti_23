If we increase the percentage of the validation set, we have less data available for training the model. This can lead to a decrease in the model's ability to generalize and may result in overfitting. The model may become too specialized in the training data, resulting in lower performance on unseen data, as represented by the validation set. On the other hand, if we reduce the percentage of the validation set, we have more data available for training the model. This can potentially improve the model's ability to generalize, as it has access to a larger training set. However, with a smaller validation set, there may be a higher chance of overfitting, as the model might not receive sufficient feedback on its performance.\n"

When the train set is larger, the model has more examples to learn from, and it may be able to capture more complex patterns and relationships in the data. This can potentially improve the model's performance on both the validation and test sets. Conversely, if the train set is smaller, the model may have limited exposure to the data and may struggle to learn the underlying patterns effectively.
